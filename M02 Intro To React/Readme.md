# why React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page.
- Using react,you have to do the code in JsX instead in script tag.
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components. 
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is far better than updating the content using DOM manipulation.
- Debugging and maintainance is so easy.

# What is React?
- React is an library that is written in javascript that we have to use.

# START WITH REACT.
- Open VS code
- To make the project
  npx-create-react-app 'project name'
- To run the project
  npm start
- It will generally run on localhost:3000

# Folder Structuring in react
- node modules folder contains the code that we have installed.
- public folder: directly accessibe files are present.
- index.html: this file runs on server

# NOTE: state means that can be in DOM and also we can change it.

# Props:
-We can also pass the data in the props.
