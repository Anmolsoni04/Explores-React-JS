# Project Title

## Basic Key Points

1. This project uses JSX, not HTML.
2. In HTML, we use `div class="abc">`, but in JSX, we use `div className="abc">`.
3. JSX simply means we use JavaScript in HTML. Note that we can't return more than one root element in JSX.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure:

- **src**
  - **App.jsx**: Main application file where the primary JSX is written.
  - **App.css**: Styles specific to the `App.jsx` component.
  - **index.css**: Root CSS file for global styles.
  - **main.jsx**: Entry point for the React application.
  - **assets**: Contains images, logos, SVGs, etc.
  - **components**: Contains sub-components, each with their respective JSX and CSS files, e.g., `Navbar.jsx`, `Navbar.css`.

## Steps to Follow

1. Write JSX code in `App.jsx`.
2. Create a `components` folder within the `src` directory and add your component files there, e.g., `Navbar.jsx` for the component and `Navbar.css` for its styles.
3. Use `index.css` as the root file for global CSS styles.

## Props

Props are used for passing data from one component to another, allowing for dynamic and reusable components.
